Go to the Chrome menu > Settings > Show advanced settings...
and deselect "Predict network actions to improve page load 
performance." If this does not resolve the issue, we 
recommend selecting this option again for improved performance.

Add Google Chrome as a permitted program in your firewall's or
antivirus software's settings. If it is already a permitted 
program, try deleting it from the list of permitted programs 
and adding it again.

your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is 
working.
