							In botany, a fruit is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of
							the flower, one or more ovaries, and in some cases accessory tissues. Fruits are the 
							means by which these plants disseminate seeds. Many of them that bear edible fruits, 
							in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic
							relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition, respectively; in fact, humans
							and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
